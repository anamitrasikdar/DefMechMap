# NOTE:
#
##  The scripts aim to calculate the deformation mechanism map (e.g., Bruijn and Skemer, 2014) for quartz and feldspar using flow law constants.
##  The constants are mentioned in the script. Users can modify the constants to get the desired results.
##  The temperatures are deduced from the microstructural observations.
##  The pressure can be calculated using any desired geotherm. 
##  The fugacity factors can be taken from literature. (e.g., Tödheide, 1972).
##  Units of the parameters are mentioned in the scripts. Necessary conversions are required.
