# NOTE:

## The scripts aim to calculate the deformation mechanism map (e.g., Bruijn and Skemer, 2014) for quartz and feldspar using flow law constants.

## The constants are mentioned in the script. Users can modify the constants to get the desired results.
## The temperatures are deduced from the microstructural observations.
## The pressure can be calculated using any desired geotherm. 
## The fugacity factors can be taken from literature. (e.g., TÃ¶dheide, 1972).
## Units of the parameters are mentioned in the scripts. Necessary conversions are required.
